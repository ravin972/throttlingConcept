# Throttling Concept

Throttling is a concept implemented in this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interesting visual effect with mouse movement. The project demonstrates the use of the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) and the implementation of a throttle function.

## Project Overview

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`). Here's a brief overview of each component:

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. It includes the following elements:

- Metadata and document structure.
- A container with two headings, where the second heading has a transparent text stroke effect.
- JavaScript libraries (GSAP) and the JavaScript file (`script.js`) for interactivity.

### CSS (style.css)

The CSS file contains styles that define the appearance and layout of the web page. Some key styles include:

- Resetting default margins and paddings.
- Setting a background color for the page.
- Centering the container and styling headings.

### JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript file includes a throttle function and event listener for mouse movement. The main functionality of the script involves creating and animating div elements with images in response to mouse movement within the `.container` element.

## Usage
